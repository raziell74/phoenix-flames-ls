#### **TailwindCSS**

- **Utility-First Styling:**
  - Build interfaces using Tailwind CSS utility classes for a consistent, maintainable design.
  - Avoid inline styles in favor of reusable Tailwind utilities.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Use responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adapt layouts for various screen sizes.
  - Design mobile‑first, then enhance for larger viewports by adjusting typography, spacing, and element sizes.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Write clean, minimal Tailwind classes to reduce CSS bloat.
  - Organize classes logically within markup to improve readability.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Adhere to the project’s design system for consistency.
  - Periodically review and remove unused classes to maintain optimal performance.
