#### **Recharts**

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Build interactive, data‑driven visualizations using Recharts components (e.g., `LineChart`, `BarChart`).
  - Pass data through well‑defined props to support dynamic updates.
  - Incorporate built‑in elements (tooltips, legends, axes) and apply Tailwind classes to align with ShadCN’s visual style.

- **ShadCN Compatibility:**
  - Follow ShadCN’s chart component guidelines to ensure visual consistency with the rest of the UI.
  - Align typography, spacing, and color schemes with ShadCN’s design system.
  - Leverage utility‑first styling to seamlessly integrate Recharts components within the ShadCN UI framework.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Always wrap charts in `ResponsiveContainer` to guarantee fluid adaptation to different screen sizes.
  - Set appropriate minimum and maximum dimensions to maintain legibility on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
  - Adjust fonts, margins, and label orientations based on viewport size in line with ShadCN’s responsive design principles.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize rendering by managing state and prop updates effectively; use memoization (e.g., `useMemo`) when appropriate.
  - Limit data complexity to avoid performance bottlenecks.
  - Apply debouncing or throttling for interactive updates such as resizing or zooming.

- **Interactivity & Accessibility:**
  - Enhance charts with interactive features (e.g., hover effects, clickable elements) to improve user engagement.
  - Ensure accessibility by incorporating proper ARIA attributes and supporting keyboard navigation.
  - Test charts across various devices and for accessibility compliance, adhering to both ShadCN and WCAG standards.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Develop reusable chart components that integrate seamlessly with the ShadCN UI design system.
  - Write comprehensive tests to validate chart behavior with diverse data sets and across screen sizes.
  - Document customization options, integration details, and performance considerations for ongoing maintenance.
