#### **tRPC**

- **Type-Safe API Endpoints:**
  - Define queries and mutations using tRPC to enforce end-to-end type safety.
  - Leverage TypeScript’s inference and use Zod (or similar) for input/output validation.

- **Modular Router Organization:**
  - Organize related procedures into feature-specific routers.
  - Merge individual routers into a unified API router.
  - Use descriptive names and document each router and procedure with inline comments.

- **Integration with Next.js:**
  - Integrate tRPC within Next.js using API routes or the App Router to support SSR, SSG, and client-side rendering.
  - Maintain a clear separation between API logic and UI components.

- **Creating New tRPC Routes:**
  - Define new procedures in the appropriate feature router.
  - Validate inputs with Zod schemas and handle errors gracefully.
  - Follow the T3 documentation for structuring and naming new routes consistently.

- **Consuming tRPC Routes in Components:**
  - Use tRPC hooks (e.g., `api.<router>.<procedure>.useQuery()` and `useMutation()`) in components or pages.
  - Handle loading, error, and success states following patterns from the T3 documentation.
  - Ensure data fetching is managed appropriately within React’s lifecycle (e.g., using hooks like `useEffect` when needed).

- **Error Handling & Middleware:**
  - Implement centralized error handling through tRPC middleware.
  - Use middleware to enforce authentication, logging, and additional validations across API endpoints.

- **Performance & Optimization:**
  - Design procedures to return only the necessary data to avoid over-fetching.
  - Consider caching strategies where applicable.
  - Periodically review and refactor API endpoints for optimal performance.

- **Documentation & Consistency:**
  - Document each procedure with clear comments on expected inputs, outputs, and error cases.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions and coding standards across all tRPC routers and procedures.
