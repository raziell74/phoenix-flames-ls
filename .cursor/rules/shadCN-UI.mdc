#### **ShadCN UI**

- **Component Usage & Composition:**
  - Use ShadCN UI components as the core building blocks for your interface.
  - Compose small, modular components to build complex UIs while keeping boundaries clear.
  - Emphasize reusability by abstracting common patterns into higher‑order or custom components.

- **Customization & Theming:**
  - Override default styles with Tailwind CSS classes to align with your project’s design language.
  - Create custom variants as needed while ensuring a consistent visual identity.
  - Rely on utility‑first principles to fine‑tune component appearance without over‑complicating the code.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure components meet WCAG guidelines using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
  - Verify keyboard accessibility and focus management through manual testing.
  - Document accessibility considerations for future reference.

- **Performance & Responsiveness:**
  - Optimize components for responsiveness across various devices using responsive design principles.
  - Prevent excessive re‑renders by applying memoization techniques where appropriate.
  - Test components on multiple screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior and legibility.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Maintain clear documentation for component usage and customization.
  - Regularly review and refactor components to align with evolving best practices.
  - Ensure seamless integration with related libraries (e.g., Zustand, Next.js) for a cohesive UI experience.
