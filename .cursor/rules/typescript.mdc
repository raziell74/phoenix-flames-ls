#### **Typescript**

- **Strict Typing & Type Safety:**
  - Write all code in TypeScript and enforce explicit types wherever possible
  - Avoid the use of `any`; use `unknown` when the type is uncertain and perform proper type narrowing before usage
  - Leverage TypeScript's type inference while ensuring that complex or critical structures have explicit type annotations

- **Code Cleanliness:**
  - Remove all unused variables and imports
  - Use the `--noUnusedLocals` and `--noUnusedParameters` compiler options to catch unused code
  - Delete commented-out code instead of leaving it in the codebase
  - Remove any dead code paths or unreachable code

- **Explicit Type Declarations:**
  - Always annotate function parameters and return types to improve code readability and maintainability
  - Define data structures with interfaces or type aliases to clearly describe the expected shape of data
  - Use union and intersection types to accurately represent values that could have multiple shapes or behaviors

- **Advanced Types & Patterns:**
  - Utilize generics to build flexible, reusable functions and components while preserving type safety
  - Employ enums to represent fixed sets of related constants
  - Implement discriminated unions for handling complex conditional types and enabling safe exhaustive checks
  - Use mapped types, conditional types, and utility types (such as `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Record`) for advanced type transformations

- **Code Consistency & Best Practices:**
  - Adhere to consistent naming conventions for types, interfaces, and variables
  - Refactor and break down complex types into smaller, composable types
  - Maintain a central repository for shared type definitions to promote reuse and avoid duplication
  - Regularly review type definitions during code reviews

- **Documentation & Developer Experience:**
  - Document complex types and interfaces using inline comments or JSDoc
  - Create comprehensive documentation for shared type definitions
  - Encourage clear and precise type definitions during code reviews
